<p class=pfblock-header3>The <a href="https://macss.uchicago.edu/content/computation-workshop"> Computational Social Science Workshop </a> at the University of Chicago cordially invites you to attend this week's talk:</p>

  <a href="https://github.com/uchicago-computation-workshop/lillian_lee"> Influence: Watch your language? Analyzing phrasing effects  in movies, Twitter, and  ChangeMyView </a>
</h2>

<br>

<p class=footertext2>

**Summary:** This talk will focus on the effect of phrasing, emphasizing aspects that go beyond just the selection of one particular word over another.  The issues we'll consider include: Does the way in which something is worded in and of itself have an effect on whether it is remembered or attracts attention, beyond its content or context? Can we characterize how different sides in a debate frame their arguments, in a way that goes beyond specific lexical choice (e.g., "pro-choice" vs. "pro-life")?  The settings we'll explore range from memorable movie quotes, to posts that do or do not catch on in Twitter, to arguments that persuade in the ChangeMyView subreddit.  

Joint work with Justin Cheng, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, Vlad Niculae, Bo Pang, and Chenhao Tan.

**Lillian Lee** is a professor of computer science and of information science at Cornell University, and co-editor-in-chief of the Transactions of the ACL (TACL). Her research interests include natural language processing and computational social science. She is a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), the recipient of one of three inaugural awards for the Test of Time (2002-2012) Paper on Computational Linguistics, and best paper awards at NAACL 2004 (joint with Regina Barzilay) and the IJCAI 2016 Natural Language Processing meets Journalism workshop (joint with Liye Fu and Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil). She earned a citation in "Top Picks: Technology Research Advances of 2004" by Technology Research News (also joint with Regina Barzilay). Her co-authored work has received several mentions in the popular press, including The New York Times, NPR's All Things Considered, and NBC's The Today Show, and one of her co-authored papers on the memorability of movie quotes was publicly called "boring" by YouTubers Rhett and Link in a video viewed 2.6 million times.
